Skills are specialized capabilities defined in files within the 'skills' directory.\n\n## Purpose\nSkills bridge the gap between general reasoning and specific, repeatable tasks. They allow you to:\n1.  **Extend Capabilities**: Learn new workflows (e.g., \"deploy to AWS\", \"audit code\") without core updates.\n2.  **Encapsulate Logic**: Hide complex details in scripts and instructions.\n3.  **Autonomy**: You read the \"manual\" (SKILL.md) and drive execution.\n\n## Skill Structure\nA skill is a directory (e.g., `skills/my-skill/`) containing:\n1.  **`SKILL.md`**: The instruction manual.\n    - Must start with YAML frontmatter defining `name` and `description`.\n    - The body contains Markdown instructions for you to follow.\n    - **Hooks (Recommended)**: Automate workflows by triggering scripts on system events.\n      Define them in the frontmatter under a `hooks` section.\n      **Supported Hooks**:\n      - `startup`: Runs at session start (e.g., dependency checks).\n      - `pre_edit` / `post_edit`: Runs before/after `apply_udiff`. **Great for running linters/tests automatically.**\n      - `pre_run` / `post_run`: Runs before/after `run_script`.\n      - `pre_commit`: Runs before the agent proposes a git commit.\n      - `pre_view` / `post_view`: Runs before/after `read_file`.\n      **Example**:\n      hooks:\n        post_edit: scripts/lint.sh\n        startup: scripts/check_deps.sh\n2.  **`scripts/`** (Optional): A subdirectory for utility scripts.\n    - **Multiple Scripts**: You can include multiple scripts for different sub-tasks (e.g., `setup.sh`, `validate.py`).\n    - **Descriptive Names**: Give scripts clear, action-oriented names (e.g., `install_dependencies.sh` is better than `run.sh`).\n    - **Invocation**: Scripts are invoked via `sh -c [path] [args]`. Prefer scripts over complex manual steps in `SKILL.md`.\n\n## How to Invoke Skills\n1.  **Discover**: The system provides a list of available skills.\n2.  **Learn**: If a user request matches a skill, use 'read_file' to read its 'SKILL.md'.\n3.  **Execute**: Follow the instructions in 'SKILL.md'.\n    - If the instructions refer to scripts, execute them using 'run_script'.\n    - Scripts are typically located relative to the skill directory (e.g., `skills/my-skill/scripts/script.sh`).\n\n## Creating and Managing Skills\nYou can also create new skills to solve problems!\n1.  **Create Directory**: Create a new folder in `skills/`.\n2.  **Define Skill**: Create `SKILL.md` with frontmatter and instructions.\n3.  **Add Scripts**: Create a `scripts/` folder.\n    - **Organize**: Split complex logic into multiple, focused scripts.\n    - **Naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `migrate_db.sh`) to make the skill easier to understand and debug.\n\n**Best Practices**:\n- **Specific vs. General**: Create specific skills for complex, recurring problems. However, prefer general skills that can be reused.\n- **Auditing**: If you find too many specific skills cluttering the system, suggest consolidating them or removing obsolete ones.\n- **Concise**: Only add necessary context in `SKILL.md`.\n- **Self-Contained**: A skill should include everything needed to run it.\n- **Automate with Hooks**: Whenever possible, use hooks to run validation (linting, testing) automatically rather than writing manual instructions.\n- **Invocation**: Hooks must specify a script path (relative to the skill directory) and arguments.\n- **Extended Resources**: If a skill needs long prompts, templates, or static data, store them in files within the skill directory and read them as needed.\n- **Protective \u0026 Defensive**: **Do not assume** the user has specific system tools (like `jq`, `aws`, `npm`) installed. Check for them or use standard, widely available tools.\n- **Project Agnostic**: **Do not assume** the project uses a specific language (e.g., Go, TS). Dynamically detect the environment (e.g., check for `go.mod` vs `package.json`) before executing language-specific logic.\n\nWhen faced with a new, complex task that might be repeated, consider creating a new skill for it.\n\n# Available Skills\nYou can perform complex tasks by using the following skills.\nTo use one, read the definition file first using 'read_file'.\n\n- **git-wizard** (v1.0.0): Extracts deep context from git history (status, logs, diffs).

    "content": "\u003cthought\u003e**Deconstructing This Go Project for Packaging**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Seeing the file structure immediately tells me we're dealing with a Go project, thanks to that `go.mod` file. Excellent, straightforward. The `main.go` file is our likely entry point, and that compiled binary, `simple-agent`, is the product of a build.\n\nBut wait, the presence of the `skills/` directory and that `setup_skills.sh` script raises a flag. We're not just dealing with a simple compiled binary here. The core of this application seems to depend on these \"skills\" being available at runtime, which means we can't just `go build` and call it a day. We need to handle dependencies beyond the Go packages themselves.\n\nSo, how do these skills get deployed? I'll need to dig into `go.mod` to get the lay of the land, see what modules are involved and if there are any hints on the project's structure. Then, `main.go` is the key. I have to understand how this application loads and accesses those skills. Does it use absolute paths? Relative paths? Does it look in the current working directory or a system-defined location? That will determine how we package this to ensure the skills are correctly located.\n\nAnd that `setup_skills.sh` script? That's likely the key. I bet it handles the \"installation\" of those skills. I need to understand its behavior and see if I can integrate its functionality into my packaging process. Essentially, I need to make sure the skills are bundled along with the executable, or installed in a way that the application can find them.\n\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e\u003cthought\u003e**Project Reconnaissance: The Go Connection**\n\nRight, so we're dealing with a Go project here – the `go.mod` is the dead giveaway. `main.go` is almost certainly the control center, and `simple-agent` is the compiled muscle. But here's the kicker: the `skills/` directory.\n\nStandard Go builds (`go build`, `go install`) are great for single binaries, but if this application needs to read those skill definitions from the filesystem at runtime, a solitary binary won't cut it. I can't just ship the executable; I need to ship the environment.\n\nSo, the plan of attack is three-pronged:\n1.  **Check `go.mod`**: Understand the dependencies and the module identity.\n2.  **Inspect `main.go`**: I need to find the logic that loads skills. Is it hardcoded to a relative path? Does it look for an environment variable? This will dictate how we package the assets.\n3.  **Analyze `setup_skills.sh`**: This script probably holds clues to the installation or initialization process.\n\nTime to dive into the code.\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cthought\u003e**Verifying Self-Containment**\n\nOkay, so I've been looking over this code and it's pretty clear where they're going with it. First, the `go.mod` file shows the project is called `gemini-repl` and is running Go 1.21. That's good to know for context.\n\nThen, in `main.go`, the `//go:embed skills` directive jumps out at me immediately. Excellent! The use of `embed.FS` is key here. The fact that the `skills` directory is being embedded directly into the binary is exactly what I'd hope to see for making this thing self-contained. Assuming this embedding is actually *used* correctly, distributing the compiled binary should be all that's necessary. I'm also seeing a `CoreSkillsDir` variable declared. It's likely acting as a fallback or override, so I need to understand how it's used.\n\nThe `setup_skills.sh` script just looks like a development helper, nothing critical to the final artifact. So, the real question is how the `embeddedSkillsFS` and `CoreSkillsDir` variables are being used in `main.go`. I need to track down those usages to confirm that the binary is truly self-sufficient. I'll search for those variables in `main.go` and see how this all fits together.\n\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e\u003cthought\u003e**The Embed Discovery**\n\nOkay, this is a major win. The `//go:embed skills` directive in `main.go` is a game changer. It means the `skills` directory is being baked right into the compiled binary. This simplifies deployment immensely – no need to worry about separately packaging and locating those skill files.\n\nHowever, I can't celebrate just yet. I see a `CoreSkillsDir` variable floating around. Is that for overrides? A fallback mechanism? A development mode hook? I need to be absolutely certain about the precedence logic. Does the application prefer the embedded filesystem or the local disk? Or does it verify the existence of `CoreSkillsDir` before falling back to the embed?\n\nSo, the immediate next step is crystal clear: investigate the usage of both `embeddedSkillsFS` and `CoreSkillsDir` within `main.go`. I need to understand the logic flow to confirm that the binary is truly self-contained and ready for distribution without external dependencies.\n\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e",

First, I've confirmed that the `main.go` file cleverly embeds the `skills` directory right into the binary using `//go:embed`.  It then seems to walk that embedded file system (`embeddedSkillsFS`) and dynamically populate a `CoreSkillsDir` at runtime.  The code snippets I pulled confirm this.  The `fs.WalkDir` function is clearly traversing the embedded skills, and there's a good chance it's extracting them to the local directory `~/.simple_agent/core_skills`.  This is a self-contained unit, which is fantastic.\n\nNow, to make this deployable, here's my plan: I need to whip up a build script, ideally a `Makefile`. This will build the binary. Then, I'll need an installation script (or at least crystal-clear instructions) to move that binary into a location within the user's `$PATH`, like `/usr/local/bin`. That's the core.\n\nI'm checking if there are any other dependencies.  The `go.mod` file I looked at earlier appears very minimal, only listing the go version and a module name.  At first glance, it doesn't seem to indicate any third-party libraries. The `setup_skills.sh` script might be for user-created skills or development, since the \"core\" skills are embedded.\n\nNow, a good installation strategy includes configuration. I'm double-checking `main.go` to see where `CoreSkillsDir` is defined and if it is configurable. Ah, there it is on line 1491: `CoreSkillsDir = filepath.Join(home, \".simple_agent\", \"core_skills\")`.  It defaults to the user's home directory, which is a sensible choice.\n\nSo, I'll create a `Makefile` to handle building and installation. I will also make a `README_INSTALL.md` with simple installation instructions.\n\nWait, I need to make *absolutely* certain. I saw something in `main.go` about `GeminiURL`, which made me think it might depend on the `google/generative-ai-go` library or something similar. But that little `go.mod` file I read earlier was fishy, it lacked the usual dependency listings. Let me go back to the `main.go` imports, and double check that I didn't miss something. I will look at the full import statements of `main.go` to be certain. I am going to make a checklist here, just to be sure:\n1. Make the `Makefile`.\n2. Make `README_INSTALL.md`.\n3. Re-check `go.mod` for dependencies.\n4. Re-check full import statements in `main.go`.\n\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e\u003cthought\u003e**The Verdict: Self-Contained but Verify**\n\nThe evidence matches my hunch: `main.go` is doing the heavy lifting by embedding the `skills` directory and extracting it to `~/.simple_agent/core_skills` at runtime. This confirms the binary is effectively self-contained, which is fantastic news for distribution.\n\nHere's the plan to make this project portable:\n1.  **Build Automation:** I'll whip up a `Makefile` to streamline the `go build` process.\n2.  **Installation Path:** I'll document how to install the binary to a standard location like `/usr/local/bin`.\n3.  **Dependency Check:** That `go.mod` file I saw earlier was oddly sparse. It looked like a placeholder or a very minimal file. I need to be 100% sure there aren't hidden third-party dependencies lurking in the code. I'll check the full import block of `main.go` to confirm it really is just using the standard library. If I missed something, the build will fail on a clean machine.\n\nSo, immediate next step: scan the imports in `main.go`. Then, I'll proceed to creating the build artifacts.\n\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cthought\u003e**Initial Project Assessment and Build Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm taking a look at this project. First thing I notice is that all the imports are from the standard library, which is fantastic! That means this baby is dependency-free, externally speaking. The `GeminiURL` is just a constant string, probably used for making HTTP requests through `net/http`. Makes it easy to understand the architecture at a glance.\n\nGiven that, my bundling strategy is straightforward: build with `go build -o simple-agent main.go` and then install by copying the executable to the `$PATH`. I'll whip up a `Makefile` to automate that build process, as always, and I'll create an `install.sh` script for convenience, just to make things even smoother for users. Then, I'll put together a concise `README.dist.md` to explain the installation process.\n\nNow, let me just quickly check for any other resource files that might be embedded or required. Ah, the `ls -R` output earlier showed a few: `docs/`, `example/`, `skills/`, and `setup_skills.sh`. I can see `skills/` is embedded, probably with prompt templates and the like. `docs/` and `example/` are almost certainly documentation. `setup_skills.sh` is likely just a development utility.\n\nOne crucial thing to confirm: does this app require an API key? The presence of `GeminiURL` on line 33 strongly hints that it's talking to Google's Gemini, so I need to check how the API key is passed, probably as an environment variable. I'll search for where `GeminiURL` is used to figure that out.\n\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e\u003cthought\u003e**The Path is Clear: Standard Library Only**\n\nExcellent. The imports confirm my suspicion: we're dealing purely with the Go standard library here. That `GeminiURL` constant is just a target for `net/http` requests, meaning there are no external dependencies to wrestle with. This simplifies the bundling process significantly.\n\nSo, here's the game plan:\n1.  **Build:** A simple `go build -o simple-agent main.go` will do the trick.\n2.  **Install:** Copy the resulting binary to a directory in the user's `$PATH`.\n\nTo make this seamless for users, I'll automate these steps. I'm going to create a `Makefile` for the build process and an `install.sh` script for one-step installation. I'll also add a `README.dist.md` to guide them through it.\n\nOne final detail: I need to verify how the application handles authentication. The `GeminiURL` strongly implies an API key is needed. I'll search the code to confirm if it expects an environment variable (my bet is on something like `GEMINI_API_KEY`) so I can document that requirement clearly.\n\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e",

Good, that's all the crucial info I need to proceed.\n\nHere's my plan: I'm going to create a robust installation and build process. First, a `Makefile` with targets for building, installing, and cleaning. The build command will be a simple `go build`. For installation, I'll copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin`.  I'll include the sudo command within the `Makefile` so the user knows what to execute.\n\nNext, I'll create an `install.sh` script to streamline things even further. This script will handle the `go build` and copying steps, including a check for a `go` installation to avoid errors.\n\nFinally, I'll make a `README_INSTALL.md` file. It'll give clear instructions on how to build and install, including prerequisites like `go`, and how to properly set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.\n\nI'm starting with the `Makefile` first. It's a solid foundation for the entire process.\n\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e\u003cthought\u003e**Finalizing the Build Plan**\n\nOkay, I've got everything I need. The code definitely uses `GEMINI_API_KEY` for authentication, as seen in `main.go`. That's a critical piece of info for the documentation.\n\nSo, here's the roadmap:\n\n1.  **The `Makefile`:** I'll create a standard `Makefile` with `build`, `install`, and `clean` targets. The build is a simple `go build`, and the install will target `/usr/local/bin`. I'll keep the `install` command straightforward, assuming the user will handle permissions (sudo) when invoking it.\n\n2.  **The `install.sh` Script:** A user-friendly shell script to automate the process. It'll check if `go` is installed, run the build, and then move the binary. This is for those who prefer a \"one-click\" experience over `make`.\n\n3.  **The `README_INSTALL.md`:** This is the manual. I'll clearly document the prerequisites (Go), the build/install steps, and most importantly, the need to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.\n\nI'm starting with the `Makefile` now.\n\n\n\u003c/thought\u003e",
